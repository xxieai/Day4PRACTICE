        "tone()" is a built-in Arduino function that plays a tone on a buzzer.
        Parameters:
            1. int pin: the pin number where the buzzer is connected
            2. int frequency: the frequency of the tone
            3. int duration: the duration of the tone in milliseconds

        Example:
            tone(BUZZER_PIN, NOTE_C4, 500);
            BUZZER_PIN is the pin number where the buzzer is connected
            NOTE_C4 is the frequency of the tone, it can be found in "pitches.h"
            500 is the duration of the tone in milliseconds
